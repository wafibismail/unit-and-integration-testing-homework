This is a homework assigned by my Software Engineering lecturer, who suggested several videos to choose from, though since we're free to use testing frameworks other than the ones suggested and as I have found ahother particular video on YouTube to be of my interest I have decided to go with it instead.

I followed guidelines in Karl Jensen's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5JSwL56p2A](Unit & Integration Testing w/ Jest - August 10th 2020) ([https://github.com/jensen/jest-notes/](Github link)) <br>

I went with the live testing example in the video (code in example folder). Still working on it
